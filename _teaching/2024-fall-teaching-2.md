**Course Description:** Algebra is a key discipline within mathematics and is likely to be integral to any
research field you choose during your graduate studies. The Math 701/702 sequence aims to give you
a comprehensive introduction to algebra and equip you with a robust foundation for exploring more
complex topics in the future. Through numerous examples, problem-solving exercises, and proofs,
you will hone your algebraic intuition. Another key objective of this course is to prepare you for the
Algebra Qualifying Exam. In Math 701, we will start by revisiting group theory before progressing to
more advanced subjects. Later in the course, we will shift our focus to ring theory. We plan to explore
Chapters 1-9 of Dummit and Foote, though not every section will be covered
