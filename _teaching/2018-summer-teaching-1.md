**Course Description:** This course, for graduate students in mathematics, addresses the theory of functions of one complex variable with a focus on the qualifying examination in complex analysis. The course covers the representation of holomorphic functions by power series and by integrals; complex line integrals, Cauchy's integral formula, and some applications; singularities of holomorphic functions, Laurent series, and computation of definite integrals by residues; the maximum principle and Schwarz's lemma, and conformal mapping,  infinite products, the Weierstrass factorization theorem, Mittag-Leffler’s theorem, normal families, proof of the Riemann mapping theorem, analytic continuation, Runge’s approximation theorem, harmonic functions, and Picard’s theorems.
