**Course Description:** This course aims to provide an introductory exploration into algebraic numbers and algebraic integers. Algebraic number theory extends its focus beyond integers, particularly emphasizing number fields as finite algebraic extensions of *Q*. The following topics will be covered in the course as time permits: (1) Algebraic numbers and algebraic integers. (2) Number fields and the study of rings containing algebraic integers. (3) Quadratic and cyclotomic fields. (4) Dedekind domains. (5) Factorization of algebraic integers and the unique factorization of ideals. (6) Minkowski’s Theorem and the geometry of numbers. (7) Ideal classes and the finiteness of the class number. (8) Dirichlet’s unit theorem. (9) Splitting of prime ideals in extensions and Artin reciprocity. (10) *L*-functions and formulas for class numbers.
